# Comprehensive Surveying and Geospatial Analysis Using Advanced Instrumentation and Software Tools
This repository contains the comprehensive report and data from our survey camp at Arogyadham, Chitrakoot, conducted as part of the CE 673 course on Instrumentation Laboratory and Field Practices in Geoinformatics. During the camp, we conducted road profiling and total station surveying, resulting in detailed topographic maps and terrain profiles. Utilizing the Trimble R10 GNSS receiver and Juno B3, we collected precise geospatial data, complemented by EDMI calibration for enhanced measurement accuracy. The data was processed and visualized using QGIS and ArcGIS, leading to the creation of contour maps, feature maps, and navigational maps essential for infrastructure development planning.

The navigational maps and detailed topographic data generated during this survey have significant practical applications, particularly in a pilgrimage area like Arogyadham, Chitrakoot. These maps can aid in the planning and development of infrastructure projects, such as improved road networks, facilities for pilgrims, and better land management. With precise geospatial data, future projects can ensure that development is sustainable and well-integrated with the natural landscape, enhancing accessibility and safety for visitors.
